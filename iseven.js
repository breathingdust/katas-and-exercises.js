Hereâ€™s another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:

 Zero is even.

 One is odd.

 For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.

Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a number parameter and return a Boolean.
